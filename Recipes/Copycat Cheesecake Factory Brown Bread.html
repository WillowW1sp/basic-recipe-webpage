    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <img src="../Images/ingredients-bread.webp" alt="image of all ingredients" height="250" width="300">
        <li>Whisk together warm water and 1 tablespoon honey in a bowl until combined. Sprinkle yeast over top and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <img src="../Images/flour.webp" alt="A bowl of flower and yeast" height="250" width="300">
        <li>Whisk together 2 Â½ cups bread flour, whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
        <img src="../Images/four+chocolate.webp" alt="A bowl with flower, and cocoa powder" width="300" height="250">
        <li>Add the yeast mixture, butter, 1/4 cup honey, and molasses. Mix with a wooden spoon until combined.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead 5 to 8 minutes until dough is smooth, and slightly tacky, adding 2 tablespoons of bread flour at a time to help work the dough.</li>
        <img src="../Images/dough.webp" alt="A ball of dough on a white background" width="300" height="250">
        <li> Form dough into a large ball and place in a greased bowl. Cover bowl and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Punch dough down and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. </li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 4 equal sized pieces, and shape into small loaves, roughly 6 inches long and 2 inches wide.</li>
        <li> Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour cornmeal onto a plate and dip the bottoms of the loaves in the cornmeal to lightly coat.</li>
        <li>Arrange loaves on prepared baking sheet, leaving ample space in between. Lightly moisten tops of loaves with a little water; sprinkle tops with oats.</li>
        <li>Cover loaves loosely with greased plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until nearly doubled in size, 45 to 60 minutes.</li>
        <img src="../Images/bred.webp" alt="the raw loafs of bread on a baking sheets" width="300" height="250">
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove plastic wrap from loaves and bake until loaves are golden brown and a thermometer inserted in the center of the loaves reads 190 degrees F (88 degrees C), 25 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer loaves to a wire rack to cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
